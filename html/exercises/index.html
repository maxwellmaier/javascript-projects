    <h1>Why I Love Web Development</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Getting to create code from nothing.</li>
      <li>Solving problems I didn't ever think I could solve</li>
      <li>Getting to know others networking for a new life</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I have thought about what I might want to do with this web development superpower.<br> I think involving my love to disc golf is a great way to maintain interest. <br> So I think it would be neat to make a website that helps reunited disc golf players with their lost discs.</p>
